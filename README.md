# Introduction
This is my Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world_population_dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

This project involves creating visualizations to explore the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in a population dataset. Specifically, the focus is on visualizing the distribution of ages or genders using bar charts and histograms. The visualizations help in understanding the demographic distribution .

# Tools
1. Pandas
2.Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

# Throughout this project, I gained several valuable insights and skills:

  ☑Working with datasets from multiple online sources:

  ⏩I learned how to efficiently retrieve and handle datasets from various websites.

  ☑Data cleaning and preprocessing:

  ⏩I understood the importance of cleaning and preparing data to ensure it’s suitable for analysis, which includes handling missing or invalid data.
  ☑Data visualization techniques:

  ⏩I gained experience in using bar charts and histograms to visualize data distributions, helping uncover patterns and trends.

  ☑Segmenting data by age groups: 

  ⏩I learned how to categorize data into different age groups and analyze these segments for more precise insights.
